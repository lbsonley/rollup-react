# Rollup-React
***Starter kit for creating React-based Libraries***

Development tooling starter kit for creating React-based libraries bundled with [Rollup](). Set up to facilitate high code quality with support for testing and linting out of the box.

## CSS-in-JS
[@emotion]() is included for styling. A base theme is provided to Storybook in `./.storybook/preview.js` and to Jest via `./test-utils.js`.

## Testing
Tests are run with [Jest]() and [Testing-Library/React]().

## Linting and Code Style
Consistent code style and modern best practices are enforced by combining [Prettier](), with [eslint]() configs [airbnb]() and [unicorn]().

## Storybook
